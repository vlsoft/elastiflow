# BREAKING NEWS! We have released the first beta of the next generation of ElastiFlow&trade; which introduces the new ElastiFlow Unified Flow Collector for Netflow, IPFIX and sFlow.

### Some of the enhancements included in the all-new collector include:

#### * Proper management templates from different devices. - NO MORE template conflicts!

#### * Improved Scalability - Over 10x more flows/sec than Logstash, over 3x more than Filebeat!

#### * Support for Option Templates - Dynamic enrichment of network interface name and application names and more!

#### * Telemetry Support - sFlow Counter Samples and other metrics from Cisco, Calix and more!

#### * Gracefully handles “unknown” Fields - No more dropped flows when a single unsupported field is encountered.

#### * Fully decodes and translates all available data - DSCP, TCP Options, ECN, Fragmentation Flags, and more.

### You can signup for access to the beta... [HERE](https://www.elastiflow.com/get-started)

I was inspired to create ElastiFlow&trade; following the overwhelmingly positive feedback received to an article I posted on Linkedin... [WTFlow?! Are you really still paying for commercial solutions to collect and analyze network flow data?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wtflow-you-really-still-paying-commercial-solutions-collect-cowart)

Dynamite-NSM is the open-source network security monitor developed by Dynamite Analytics. It provides network and cybersecurity operators with holistic insights into their networks while giving them the ability to deep-dive into lower-level activities. Dynamite-NSM builds upon the ELK stack (ElasticSearch, LogStash, Kibana) and is coupled with the fine-tuned Zeek sensor (a.k.a. Bro), flow data inputs (powered by ElastiFlow), and Suricata IDS security alerts. The solution now includes the Dynamite Lab component made of the python API for easy data access and the integrated JupyterHub data science environment.

## Getting Started

> **NOTE** - Please refer to `INSTALL.md` for installation instructions.

ElastiFlow&trade; is built using the Elastic Stack, including Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana. Please refer to [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/robcowart/elastiflow/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for instructions on how to install and configure ElastiFlow&trade;.

If you are new to the Elastic Stack, this video goes beyond a simple default installation of Elasticsearch and Kibana. It discusses real-world best practices for hardware sizing and configuration, providing production-level performance and reliability.

[![0003_es_install](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10326954/76195457-9ea2d580-61e8-11ea-8578-8fb39908afec.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZb7HpVOges)

Additionally local SSD storage should be considered as _*mandatory*_! For an in-depth look at how different storage options compare, and in particular how bad HDD-based storage is for Elasticsearch (even in multi-drive RAID0 configurations) you should watch this video...

### Threats

ElastiFlow&trade; includes a dictionary of public IP addresses that are known to have a poor reputation. This dictionary is built from many OSINT data sources, normalized to a common taxonomy. The Threats dashboard uses this IP reputation information to highlight three threat/risk types.

2. At-Risk Servers - Private Servers that are being reached by clients with a poor IP reputation.
3. High-Risk Clients - Private clients that are accessing public servers which have a poor reputation.
